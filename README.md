# Your own Covid-19 tracker Bot
This is a Covid 19 tracker Bot, which actually uses the  following link for [API](https://github.com/covid19india/api)

Here the Tensorflow latest version is what I have used. I have removed that in the requirements txt file, so if your searching for it you won't find it.

Before using this repo make sure to enable the virtual environment, so that you wouldn't mess with your other projects. 

If in any case you wanna know how to create Virtual Environment, have a look into the blog here [Link](https://medium.com/@narenltk/why-do-we-need-a-virtual-environment-ec5f4cbb9dc0)
